# MTN Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn for **MTN** using data science and machine learning techniques. The goal is to understand why customers leave (churn), extract actionable insights, and build predictive models that can help the company reduce churn and improve customer retention.


## Dataset
The dataset contains customer information such as:
- **Full Name**
- **Age**
- **Gender**
- **State**
- **Subscription plan**
- **Unit price**
- **Date of Purchase**
- **Number of times purchased**
- **Customer tenure (months)**
- **Satisfaction rate**
- **Data usage**
- **Churn status (Yes/No)**

## Methodology
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and duplicates
   - Converted categorical variables into numerical form
   - Feature engineering (e.g., age ranges, churn flag encoding)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualized churn distribution across features (age, state, satisfaction, etc.)
   - Analyzed correlations between numerical features and churn
   - Compared categorical variables with churn rates

3. **Modeling**
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Trees / Random Forest
   - Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score

4. **Evaluation**
   - Compared model performance
   - Identified most important predictors of churn


## Key Insights
- Customer satisfaction and tenure strongly influence churn probability.  
- Certain states and subscription plans have higher churn rates.  
- Usage patterns (e.g., low data usage) are correlated with churn.  


## Results
- Achieved [insert accuracy, e.g., **78% accuracy**] using Logistic Regression.
- Precision and Recall scores provided insight into how well the model identifies actual churners.  
- Generated actionable recommendations for reducing churn.

## Recommendations
- Improve customer satisfaction with better support and loyalty programs.  
- Target high-churn customer segments with retention campaigns.  
- Monitor customers with short tenure and low engagement for early intervention.  


## Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
